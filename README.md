# DAC-use-cases
Use cases for end to end implementations of detection-as-code (DAC)

### Core Components of DaC within Elastic

* CC1: Maintaining rules within a Version Control System (VCS)
* CC2: Syncing rules from VCS to Elastic Security
* CC3: Managing rules within Elastic Security (consistent with a DaC approach)
* CC4: Syncing rules from Elastic Security to VCS


### Governance Models Dictating the Core Components of DaC

* GM1: VCS as authoritative
* GM2: Elastic security as authoritative
* GM3: Dual sync between VCS and Elastic Security (optional)
